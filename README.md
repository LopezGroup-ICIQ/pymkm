## Pymkm
Pymkm is a package for developing microkinetic models for heterogeneous catalytic systems. Both thermal and electrocatalytic systems can be studied with it. The main strength of pymkm is its user-friendly way to generate information. 
Main usage of pymkm involves:
- Thermal catalysis: steady-state reaction rates, surface covergaes, apparent activation energy and reaction orders, descriptor analysis via degree of rate control and reversibility analysis.
- Electrocatalysis: steady-state current density, Tafel plots.
